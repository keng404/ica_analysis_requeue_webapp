# ica_analysis_requeue_webapp
pyscript-based web app that allows a user to generate CLI and API requeue templates

See [here](https://keneng87.pyscriptapps.com/ica-analysis-requeue/latest/) to interact with it live.

## notes
- python script ```main.py``` contains logic to render elements in the ```index.html```.
- index.html is stylized by ```assets/css/examples.css```.

### todos

- [ ] create loading pages for each button press
- [ ] add more explanations of CLI/API arguments
- [ ] add ability to reupload file for requeue
- [ ] is it possible to embed ICA CLI into app?
